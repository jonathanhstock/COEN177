Step1 lists out all of the files in the folder. 
Step2 writes the current executable with spaces in between each character through a pipe. 
Step3 does the same as step2 but instead just modifies it by using the ls command to list out all of the executables and files in the folder.
Step4 prints out the root of the folder and cats out whatever is in the root.
Step5 creates a producer and consumer which inputs a message and outputs that message to the other end of the pipe. 
Step6 creates 10 threads through different iterations printing out the exact address of the thread when created and the iteration
number that it is currently on which can be out of order sometimes. Then it returns the thread in order of creation. 
The bug in step6 is that sometimes the iteration numbers repeat and are out of order as well. This is probably because they run asynchronously
and share the same address space. 
Step7 adjusts by creating a void* pointer to the i and a size_t type to adjust for when it is an int and when it is a pointer.
