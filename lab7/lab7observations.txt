In this lab we used Minix just like last week. I did the "setup vmware" command then did "minix-get-image" and "vmware &" then I clicked on the minix3 option on the left and launched it. The username I entered was root and my password was the one I created earlier. I then typed in "tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &" to get ftp ready and then typed "ifconfig". Then I moved to the computer terminal and typed "ftp [ip address]" where ip address is the one I received from ifconfig. Next, in the virtual machine I navigated to the directory /usr/src/kernel and found the file proc.c where I then moved it to the linux machine through ftp get. I found the function pick_proc and edited it to have a random variable r mod 10. Then I added an if statement that checked if q was greater than 3 and r was less than 3 then q would become 15-r because the processes queue size is from 0 to 15. Next I used ftp put to transfer the file back into the virtual machine. Then I tested it by rebooting the virtual machine and timing the time to reboot with the new process versus the old process.
