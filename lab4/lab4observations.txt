Step1: This program runs 20 threads in a row just like the last lab. You basically get the same result everytime you run this program.
If you are streaming a video in the background then it runs the program faster and in order of what threads come in and which are returned.
The variables are per thread. The compiler stores these variable states in the memory. The main function variable i is shared state and
the compiler stores the variable in the memory. 
Step2: The possible outputs of the program are just the hello from thread with threadid and the main thread done.
Step3: This program uses threads to multiply matrices. It starts by initializing one matrix to numbers from 0 to 1024 then intializes the
second matrix to all 0's. It prints out both of these matrices and then creates a thread to copy the first matrix into the second matrix. 
Then it creates another thread to multiply every entry in the first matrix by 2. Then it prints out the result of the updated first matrix.
