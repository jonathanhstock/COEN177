Title: Lab2 - Observations

For the first step of the lab when running the executable I got a segmentation fault. 
However, when running the executable with an input of 3000 the output forked up to 100 child processes. 
When entering delays of 500 and 5000 it tells the program how long to wait before forking another child process.
After creating seven processes it prints out the parent process for every child process for a total of seven processes. 
The two threads creates two threads with parent and children threads 100 times. 
The last step allows for the children to wait for the parent processes before forking.
